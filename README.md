PyMetroPaths is a project developed for the Artificial Intelligence course in the second year of Computational Mathematics and Data Analysis.
The project focuses on implementing an algorithm to find the optimal path between two points, A and B, using subway routes.
This is achieved by utilizing various heuristics, such as distance, time, or number of transfers, to determine the best route.

The project takes into account the algorithm's complexity and has been rated with a 10 out of 10.
